# AstroPhoMes

A python library implementing astrophysical photomeson models for usage in UHECR sources simulations and related physical scenarios

## Description:

This repository contains tools used for calculating photo-nuclear interactions.
The code provides cross sections for the interaction between photons and nuclei for astrophysical problems.
This is of interest for modeling Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray sources and transport.

## Usage:

For details see the publication [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07999), and for usage refer to the examples folder.

The lib folder contains the main classes which implement the photomeson models.

The model contains methods to obtain the cross sections for a variety of nuclei. 

The particle identification follows the convention below

#### Particle ID convention:

- 2: pi plus
- 3: pi minus
- 4: pi zero
- 100\*A+Z: for nuclei, where Z and A are the proton and total nucleon numbers. For example
	- 100: neutron
	- 101: proton
	- ...
	- 1407: Nitrogen 14 (Z=7, A=14)

## Dependencies:

It has been tested with the following versions (it should also work with newer versions):
- python 3.8+
- numpy 1.23+
- scipy 1.10+

Additionally this code uses interaction tables generated with [SOPHIA](https://www.uibk.ac.at/projects/he-cosmic-sources/tools/sophia/index.html.en) and [TALYS](http://www.talys.eu). These tables can be updated or substituted by other tables containing the analogous information, provided they are in the same format.
